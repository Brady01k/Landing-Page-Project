# Landing-Page-Project

I am doing this project as part of the odin project curriculum again. Since my previous project which mostly involved basic HTML and CSS, I have learned even more CSS techniques, and now including flexbox which is mostly what I am utilizing to design this landing page.

For right now this is strictly practice for the layout, which is why the buttons and links don't actually have any functionality, maybe I will add more on to this in the future, but for now it will remain as is.

I designed this for the body section to be one big container in column direction, which the flex items of this container are the containers that make up each individual section. Surprisingly, I didn't have any major difficulties, and I finished within a day, but this is with a lot of practice doing flexbox exercises over the past week or so.

Overall I'm pretty happy with the finished product, but I am still eager to learn more as this is still not even close to being a fully functional website.
